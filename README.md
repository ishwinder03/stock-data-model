# stock-data-model

This is a project where I decided to apply data visualisation and machine learning to historical stock data between 2012-2020.
I created 2 ML models: ridge linear regression model and a long short-term memory network model (LSTM).

This repository contains a project where I've leveraged data visualization and machine learning techniques to analyze historical stock data spanning from 2012 to 2020. The main goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive models for stock price movements.

Project Overview:

In this project, I explored the historical stock data of various companies and the S&P500. The repository includes the following key components:

Data Gathering: I obtained historical stock price and volume data from reliable sources.
Data Preprocessing: I cleaned and transformed the raw data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis: I visualized the data to gain insights into the trends and patterns present in the stock prices and trading volumes.
Feature Engineering: I created relevant features that might have an impact on stock price movements.
Machine Learning Models: I implemented two different predictive models to forecast stock price movements.
Ridge Linear Regression Model: I trained a Ridge regression model to predict stock prices based on selected features.
Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) Model: I developed an LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network, to capture temporal dependencies in stock price data and make predictions.
Visualizations: I used visualization techniques to showcase the model predictions, compare them to actual stock prices, and analyze their accuracy.
Usage


Conclusion:

This project serves as a demonstration of applying data science and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict stock price movements. The Ridge linear regression model and LSTM model provide insights into how different algorithms can be used for predictive tasks in the financial domain. The LSTM model is more accurate and powerful due to the neural networks behind this. The code and findings presented here can be extended and customized for more in-depth analyses or applied to other datasets.
